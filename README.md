## API Security

### Key Security Measures

#### 1. Authentication
- **Implementation**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with refresh tokens
- **Purpose**: Verifies user identity for all API requests
- **Why It Matters**: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive operations

#### 2. Authorization
- **Implementation**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Purpose**: Restricts actions based on user roles (guest, host, admin)
- **Why It Matters**: Ensures users can only perform permitted actions (e.g., hosts can't modify bookings they don't own)

#### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: Throttling (e.g., 100 requests/minute per IP)
- **Purpose**: Prevents brute force attacks and API abuse
- **Why It Matters**: Protects against DDoS attacks and maintains system stability

#### 4. Data Validation & Sanitization
- **Implementation**: Input validation at API endpoints
- **Purpose**: Filters malicious payloads and malformed data
- **Why It Matters**: Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks

#### 5. Payment Security
- **Implementation**: PCI-compliant Stripe integration with tokenization
- **Purpose**: Never stores raw payment details in our database
- **Why It Matters**: Protects sensitive financial data and prevents fraud

#### 6. HTTPS Encryption
- **Implementation**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Purpose**: Encrypts data in transit
- **Why It Matters**: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping

#### 7. Audit Logging
- **Implementation**: Logs all sensitive operations
- **Purpose**: Tracks security-relevant events
- **Why It Matters**: Enables incident investigation and compliance

### Critical Protection Areas
- **User Data**: Personal information and credentials (GDPR compliance)
- **Payments**: Financial transactions and card data (PCI DSS requirements)
- **Listings**: Prevent malicious content injection
- **Bookings**: Protect against reservation fraud
